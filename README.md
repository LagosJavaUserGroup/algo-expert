# algo-expert
Our Saturday Adventures

Created a repo for archiving our algo-expert solutions. 
It is a work in progress, so, anyone who's interested can help in collating our solutions and dumping them here

How to contribute:

- select the corresponding branch [easy for easy tasks, medium for medium tasks, and so on ...]
- add a folder with the name of the task
- in this folder add a screenshot of the task description including all the hints [try to grab it in 1 snip if you can]
- then add the file for the solution using the extension of the programming language

There are examples there.... just follow the pattern for consistency's sake.
